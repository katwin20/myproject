# Salary Transparency

## Summary

This project aims at increasing the transparency in salaries across sectors and countries based on gender, race, working experience, education and employment extent amongst others. The goal is to eliminate bias in payment and provide open sources of salaries based on the given critera. This should prevent unfair and unsubstantiated payments and provide jobseekers with valuable information to rely on in salary negotiation. 

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
Salary disparity based on non-relevant factors such as gender or race are a prominent problem that everyone is aware of, yet there is no perfect solution for it. Unconciousness bias of recruiters often plays into the decision made as for who to employ. Implementing algorithms which ensure an equal proportion or quote of women or people of differing ethnicities while blanking out those factors often don't do the job. The reason is that in that case other information such as "is a cheerleader" are significant in the recruiting process. 



## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

I proposed this idea in context with the building AI online course. I am not an expert in coding but indeed enjoyed the course and wanted to complete it accordingly, which includes proposing and AI idea. Nevertheless, I would greatly appreciate feedback.
